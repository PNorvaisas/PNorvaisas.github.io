# About me

Hello, my name is Povilas and I am a Senior Bioinformatics Data Scientist at [BenevolentAI](https://benevolent.ai/). It is my passion to understand world and make it a better place to live by contributing my skills and knowledge to drug development.
# Research

I have started my research career at a time when interdisciplinarity was a way to go. I graduated BSc Biophysics at [Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt/en/) in Lithuania. Surprisingly, the study that got me interested in research had nothing to do with what I do now. During an exchange semester at [Helsinki University](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) with Prof. Eva Kidi I have developed a mathematical model for assymmetric assortative mating (ask me over a pint of beer, I know quite a bit about deer and stickleback mating habits).

At that time I was also working at the Vilnius University Insitute of Biotechnology, Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design where I investigated the basic principles of [hydrophobic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic_effect) (*one of the key forms of interaction between drugs and their targets*) using detergents as a simple model. Gradually I became fascinated with computater science and shifted my focus to molecular modelling and cheminformatics.

After graduation, I got an opportunity to do a year internship at [The Houston Methodist Research Institute](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/research/), [Department of Nanomedicine](https://www.houstonmethodist.org/research/our-research/nanomedicine/). Here I investigated nanoparticle and drug compatibility principles as well as possible mechanism behind cancer prevention using NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, think aspirin).
